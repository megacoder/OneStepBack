### OneStepBack README ###

OneStepBack is a Gnome 2 and 3 theme with some colors and embossed widgets inspired by the good old NextStep look. I'm old.

OneStepBack-lighter and OneStepBack-win are colors variations automagically derived from the genuine theme: the first uses lighter grays and the second more windowish colors.

The whole is developed from scratch, is light and minimal, uses only four shades of grays and colors. That was the challenge.

It has been tested on Arch Linux with Gnome-Shell, Gnome 3.16 and 3.18, a good amount of Gtk2 applications and only a few Gtk3 applications. A lot of widget controls are still missing and it is not tested at all with unity or xfce.

This is the version 0.7, released in XXX 2015.
For installation, unzip the archive and copy the themes in your theme directory.
